# Contribution Guidelines

PX Blue resource are now open source, available through NPM and on Github. We also have live code examples on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/@px-blue) - an online IDE that helps us code more quickly and easily.

Weâ€™re excited to make these resources available publicly, but nobody is perfect - you may run into issues or have ideas for how to improve the platform as you use it. Follow the guidelines below to let us know how we can make it better.

1. Issue Description
2. Expected Behavior
3. Current Behavior
4. Steps to Reproduce

## Contributing your own code
### To an existing repository
1. Create a Bug Report or Feature request in the repository you plan to work on
2. Fork the repository you want to update to your personal GitHub account
3. Make the changes to your local copy 
4. Create a Pull Request back to the PX Blue repository
5. We will review your changes and either accept them, or offer suggestions for any required changes

If you are making changes to a repository for code examples (i.e. StackBlitz), you will also need to update the live example.
1. Fork the StackBlitz example to your personal account
2. Make the changes to your local copy
3. Add a link to your StackBlitz example in the comments for your Pull Request
4. If your Pull Request is accepted, we will fork your StackBlitz into the PX Blue account

### New repositories
If you would like to contribute a new pattern or code examples  
1. Build your example in StackBlitz
2. Send a StackBlitz link to pxblue@eaton.com 
3. If your example is accepted, we will fork your StackBlitz into the PX Blue account
