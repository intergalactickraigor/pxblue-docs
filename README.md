# Welcome to Power Xpert Blue
## A design system for Eaton applications

Power Xpert Blue is a complete design system for front-end development at Eaton. This system will help your team build beautiful applications that adhere to our design guidelines while ensuring flexibility and code reusability. Check out our [Release Notes](./releasenotes.md) to see what's new in the latest version of PX Blue.

## Design
Power Xpert Blue is based on the [Material Design](https://material.io/) language. If you are working with our Studio Blue design team, their designs will follow this standard. If you are not utilizing Studio Blue, ensure that your designers are following the Material Guidelines, best practices for your chosen Material component library, as well as any additional PX Blue design patterns, which can be seen on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/@px-blue), e.g.:
* Login / User Registration
* Basic/Responsive Navigation
* Lists
* Toolbars

## Development
There are many open source component libraries that implement the Material Design system. In order to promote code reusability and consistency, we currently support application development with the following frameworks:

#### Web
* [Angular](https://angular.io) using [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)

#### Mobile / Hybrid
* [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) + Angular
* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
* [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) (not Ionic)
